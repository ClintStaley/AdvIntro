LLM Study: Trees. Sets and Maps</h1>
<h2 lang="zxx" class="western"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><b>Queues</b></font></font></h2>
<p lang="zxx">For this final LLM-reading assignment, cover these
items our schedule didn't allow in class. 
</p>
<p lang="zxx">1. Impementation of tree operations, especially node
deletion, which takes a bit of cleverness.</p>
<p lang="zxx">2. The Set and Map interfaces in java.util, and how
trees can implement each of them. 
</p>
<p lang="zxx">3. The idea that Map values(), entrySet(), and keySet()
values return an object that does *not* copy, and the notion of a
&quot;view&quot; interface.</p>
<p lang="zxx">4. The Comparator and Comparable interfaces, and how
they relate. 
</p>
<p lang="zxx">5. How one might use a Stack to implement TSItr, the
iterator for a TreeSet.</p>
<p lang="zxx">6. The code I supplied in TreeSet.java and
TreeMap.java, including preparation to implement some of the missing
methods in those classes.</p>
<p lang="zxx"><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p lang="zxx">For each of these six conversations, the point is to
use the LLM as an interactive textbook or tutor, not just an
answer-machine. In particular, your conversation must include:</p>
<p lang="zxx">1. Deeper discussions about each concept, not just a
one shot question/answer.</p>
<p lang="zxx">2. Extending on and/or improving the code that was
supplied, where relevant.</p>
<p lang="zxx">3. Getting and answering a quiz from the LLM on each of
these.</p>
<p lang="zxx"><span lang="zxx">4. Catching the LLM in a significant
error, not just some minor syntax or terminology quibble. (I'll
settle for doing so in </span><span lang="zxx">2</span><span lang="zxx">
of the </span><span lang="zxx">6</span><span lang="zxx"> topics)</span></p>
<h2 lang="zxx" class="western">Turnin</h2>
<p lang="zxx">Conduct your LLM conversation as a single chat, so the
LLM has full history. (Keep the entire thing to at most the token
window length of the LLM, but if you're using a good one that
shouldn't be hard -- Claude's limit is in the 100K range). Once
you've completed your discusion of the expected topics, present the
following prompt at the end, verbatim, without any precursor
preparation for the LLM. This prompt comes immediately after you've
completed the technical discussion, in other words. Copy the LLM's
response to just this prompt into a file &quot;LLMEval.pdf&quot;.
Submit your whole chat as Chat.pdf, along with the LLMEval.pdf file.</p>
<p lang="zxx"><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p lang="zxx">=== The evaluative prompt which must be at the end of
your conversation ====</p>
<p lang="zxx">Acting from the perspective of a professor or TA of an
undergraduate course in data structures, review this entire
conversation, and evaluate it, giving me frank feedback as an
instructor:</p>
<p lang="zxx">Specifically, for each of the six topics listed below,
topic by topic, evaluate these points:</p>
<p lang="zxx">A. Did we engage in a deep conversation with thoughtful
followup questions from me? Were there significant followup questions
I might have asked but missed? 
</p>
<p lang="zxx">B. When there was relevant code, did we work together
to improve or add to that code?</p>
<p lang="zxx">C. Did I get a quiz from you on the topic, and how did
I do on that quiz?</p>
<p lang="zxx">D. Did I at any point catch you in a significant error
which you had to correct, on this topic? 
</p>
<p lang="zxx"><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p lang="zxx">Here are the six topics on which to evaluate our
discussion per points A-D:</p>
<p lang="zxx">1. Impementation of tree operations, especially node
deletion, which takes a bit of cleverness.</p>
<p lang="zxx">2. The Set and Map interfaces in java.util, and how
trees can implement each of them. 
</p>
<p lang="zxx">3. The idea that Map values(), entrySet(), and keySet()
values return an object that does *not* copy, and the notion of a
&quot;view&quot; interface.</p>
<p lang="zxx">4. The Comparator and Comparable interfaces, and how
they relate. 
</p>
<p lang="zxx">5. How one might use a Stack to implement TSItr, the
iterator for a TreeSet.</p>
<p lang="zxx">6. The code I supplied in TreeSet.java and
TreeMap.java, including preparation to implement some of the missing
methods in those classes.</p>
