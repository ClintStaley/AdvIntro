LLM Study: Sorting</h1>
<p lang="zxx">For this LLM-reading assignment, cover these items our
schedule didn't allow in class. 
</p>
<p lang="zxx">1. The various strategies for pivot choosing in
Quicksort, and how the code I gave you chooses a pivot</p>
<p lang="zxx">2. The behavior of that Quicksort partition in odd
cases, e.g. already-sorted data, reverse-sorted data, all-equal data,
and how to improve it to make quicksort remain O(nlogn) under such
odd but not uncommon cases.</p>
<p lang="zxx">3. The priority queue versions of our three queues, and
how they use Comparators to enforce priority order.</p>
<p lang="zxx">4. An overview (no code needed) of the algorithms merge
sort and selection sort, which are the two second-most useful
O(nlogn) and O(n^2) sorting algorithms, respectively.</p>
<p lang="zxx">5. The concept of an &quot;inversion&quot;, and why a
sorting algorithm that removes only one inversion per step cannot be
better than O(n^2).</p>
<p lang="zxx">For each of these four conversations, the point is to
use the LLM as an interactive textbook or tutor, not just an
answer-machine. In particular, your conversation must include:</p>
<p lang="zxx">1. Deeper discussions about each concept, not just a
one shot question/answer.</p>
<p lang="zxx">2. Extending on and/or improving the code that was
supplied, where relevant.</p>
<p lang="zxx">3. Getting and answering a quiz from the LLM on each of
these.</p>
<p lang="zxx">4. Catching the LLM in a significant error, not just
some minor syntax or terminology quibble. (I'll settle for doing so
in 2 of the 4 topics)</p>
<p lang="zxx">As an example, here is a link to a conversation I just
did with Claude, on the LinkStack code we discussed in class. Note
that it has all four of these elements, for instance: 1) discussion
of garbage collection details 2) Addition of a dummy node to simplify
the deep copy 3) a four-question quiz 4) Catching the LLM on a fine
point of GC, on its inaccurate criticism of the shallow-copy
alternative (twice!), and on Q4 of the quiz. This is the sort of
conversation I'd like you to do.</p>
<p lang="zxx"><a href="https://claude.ai/share/619168d3-b1a6-4299-9f8a-492f35371f14"><span lang="zxx"><i>Example
Claude Conversation on LinkStack</i></span></a></p>
<p lang="zxx"><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h2 lang="zxx" class="western">Turnin</h2>
<p lang="zxx">Conduct your LLM conversation as a single chat, so the
LLM has full history. (Keep the entire thing to at most the token
window length of the LLM, but if you're using a good one that
shouldn't be hard -- Claude's limit is in the 100K range). Once
you've completed your discusion of the expected topics, present the
following prompt at the end, verbatim, without any precursor
preparation for the LLM. This prompt comes immediately after you've
completed the technical discussion, in other words. Copy the LLM's
response to just this prompt into a file &quot;LLMEval.pdf&quot;.
Submit your whole chat as Chat.pdf, along with the LLMEval.pdf file.</p>
<p lang="zxx"><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p lang="zxx">=== The evaluative prompt which must be at the end of
your conversation ====</p>
<p lang="zxx">Acting from the perspective of a professor or TA of an
undergraduate course in data structures, review this entire
conversation, and evaluate it, giving me frank feedback as an
instructor:</p>
<p lang="zxx">Specifically, for each of the four topics listed below,
topic by topic, evaluate these points:</p>
<p lang="zxx">A. Did we engage in a deep conversation with thoughtful
followup questions from me? Were there significant followup questions
I might have asked but missed? 
</p>
<p lang="zxx">B. When there was relevant code, did we work together
to improve or add to that code?</p>
<p lang="zxx">C. Did I get a quiz from you on the topic, and how did
I do on that quiz?</p>
<p lang="zxx">D. Did I at any point catch you in a significant error
which you had to correct, on this topic? 
</p>
<p lang="zxx"><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p lang="zxx">Here are the four topics on which to evaluate our
discussion per points A-D:</p>
<p lang="zxx">1. The various strategies for pivot choosing in
Quicksort, and how the code I gave you chooses a pivot</p>
<p lang="zxx">2. The behavior of that Quicksort partition in odd
cases, e.g. already-sorted data, reverse-sorted data, all-equal data,
and how to improve it to make quicksort remain O(nlogn) under such
odd but not uncommon cases.</p>
<p lang="zxx">3. The priority queue versions of our three queues, and
how they use Comparators to enforce priority order.</p>
<p lang="zxx">4. An overview (no code needed) of the algorithms merge
sort and selection sort.</p>
