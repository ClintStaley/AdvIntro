# STM3910C Programming Survey

## Name ___________________________________________

Please answer the questions below.  When the question asks for code, do your 
best to write the code by hand.  Don't worry about minor syntax like semicolons; 
focus on getting the code as correct as possible, and on an elegant solution.

1. Briefly describe your prior programming experience.  Was it self-taught or 
learned from a course?  What programming language(s) have you coded in?  If you 
took course(s), what grades did you get? 
```







```
2. Have you taken any STEM-related AP courses?  Which if so, and if you took the
test, how did you do?
```







```
3. Write a function to check an array/list of integers to see if it is
already in ascending sorted order.  Do this by hand with a loop; don't call any library functions.  Return true or false from the function.  There
are three function headers already supplied below, for C, Python, and Java.  Pick one to implement -- whatever language you feel best in

```
// Java function to return true/false depending on whether "vals"  is in sorted order
boolean isSorted(int[] vals) {





}
```

```
// Python function to return true/false depending on whether "vals"  is in sorted order
def isSorted(vals):





```
```
// C/C++ function to return true/false depending on whether "vals"  is in sorted order
int isSorted(int vals[], int numVals) {





}
```
