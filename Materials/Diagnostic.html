<p>Please answer the questions below. When the question asks for
code, do your best to write the code by hand. Don't worry about minor
syntax like semicolons; focus on getting the code as correct as
possible, and on an elegant solution.</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>Briefly describe your prior programming experience. Was it
	self-taught or learned from a course? What programming language(s)
	have you coded in? If you took course(s), what grades did you get? 
	</p>
</ol>
<pre class="western">

<ol start="2">
	<li><p>Have you taken any STEM-related AP courses? Which if so, and
	if you took the test, how did you do? 
	</p>

	<li><p style="page-break-before: always">Write a function to check
	an array/list of integers to see if it is already in ascending
	sorted order. Do this by hand with a loop; don't call any library
	functions. Return true or false from the function. There are three
	function headers already supplied below, for C, Python, and Java.
	Pick one to implement -- whatever language you feel best in
