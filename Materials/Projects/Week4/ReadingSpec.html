Week 4 Background Study</h1>
<h2 lang="zxx" class="western"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><b>MMind.java</b></font></font></h2>
<p lang="zxx">We reviewed much of MMind.java in class, and I leave
the rest to you to study, with possible quiz on this material.  
</p>
<p lang="zxx">Your &quot;text&quot; for this is the Java
documentation from the syllabus, but also an LLM's assistance in
understanding the code and related Java concepts.  While LLM
assistance in coding remains off limits for now, an LLM's assistance
in studying is not only encouraged, but in this assignment
*expected*.  See turnin below.  
</p>
<p lang="zxx">With your favorite LLM (I'm recently a Claude user,
though I shift around), and the JavaDocs on a browser, review every
line of MMind.java, to be sure you understand each one, including
those we have not yet covered.  Some interesting questions to
consider are below.  
</p>
<p lang="zxx">Part of this assignment is intelligent interaction with
the LLM, including following up on its answers when needed.  When you
work with an LLM, be sure you understand what it is telling you, and
verify strategically by checking other sources to preclude
hallucination.  In this context, an LLM is like a 98% accurate
instant Wikipedia.   
</p>
<p lang="zxx">Questions to work with.</p>
<p lang="zxx">1. Consider that package statement on line 1.   What
*is* a Java package, and why are they useful?  Why did I preface the
package name with com.cstaley, instead of just, say using &quot;package
MMind&quot;?   if you were setting up your own package, what package
names could you use, by convention?</p>
<p lang="zxx">2. Does &quot;import&quot; include any code from other
files into the Java file in which it appears, like it does in Python?
 If so, what kind of code?  If not, then what does it do exactly? 
What do packages have to do with import?  
</p>
<p lang="zxx">3. What does &quot;final&quot; do, and are there other
languages with a similar feature?  What keyword do they typically use
if so?</p>
<p lang="zxx">4.  If I have a long string that must be broken across
two lines to maintain &lt;= 80 cols, how do I do that?</p>
<p lang="zxx">5. What is &quot;method chaining&quot;?  What line of
code in MMind.java exemplifies this syntax?</p>
<p lang="zxx">6. What is &quot;Character&quot;?  An object? a
package? a class?  What methods does it supply?</p>
<p lang="zxx">7. What is the difference between a while and a
do-while loop?</p>
<p lang="zxx">8. What's up with line 64?  If I write bad = bad ||
test, what is the effect?  Why do we preface the right side with &quot;bad
||&quot;?</p>
<p lang="zxx">9. What happens if I omit the !bad on line 59?</p>
<p lang="zxx">10. What code should be filled in on line 68?  (Do this
w/o an LLM's help)</p>
<p lang="zxx">11. On line 60, what does the nested lineNdx++ do?  if
lineNdx == 2, for instance, will charAt receive argument 2 or 3?</p>
<p lang="zxx">12. Replace the loop on lines 22-23 with a single call
of System.arraycopy w/o using an LLM.</p>
<h2 lang="zxx" class="western">Turning In</h2>
<p lang="zxx">Main evaluation will come in the form of class quizzes,
but for Basic credit you must also show me your LLM session, with a
reasonable set of prompts from you engaging in a tutorial session,
and submit a copy of this to the assignment for the week.</p>
