Week 2</h1>
<h1 lang="zxx" class="western">Assignments</h1>
<p lang="zxx">This assignment extends the Conway Life game (see
posting ConwayLifeAns.py) as we revised it in lecture. 
</p>
<h2 lang="zxx" class="western">Basic</h2>
<h4 lang="zxx" class="western">ConwayLifeBa.py</h4>
<p lang="zxx">1. Extend the program to allow one to press one of the
number keys 1-4, then click the mouse while the key is depressed, and
as a result get one of the 4 canned patterns r-pentomino(1),
glider(2), spaceship(3), or glider gun(4). Place the center of the
pattern at the mouse click, wrapping around the edges toroidally if
needed. Do a full copy of the rectangle of the pattern, thus also
clearing any other cells than those in the pattern within its
rectangle. 
</p>
<p lang="zxx">And, *use the list provided* at the bottom of the
ConwayLifeAns.py file for the pattern contents; don't write all that
by hand!</p>
<p lang="zxx">Note that there is a pygame.MOUSEBUTTONUP event to
match the MOUSEBUTTONDOWN event. This will let you know if when keys
are released, which must be part of your logic for this to work.</p>
<p lang="zxx">2. Track the number of generations for which each
living cell has been alive. Increase the cell's darkness by 1/4 for
each generation it's been alive, so that it gradually changes from
light gray to fully black over 4 generations. Do this by changing at
most 7 lines of code in the program, and be prepared to describe
those 7 lines in your demo.</p>
<p lang="zxx">3. Add handling to the **numpad, not keyboard** + and -
keys that will, respectively, speed the simulation up or slow it down
by a factor of 2. See how fast you can run the simulation before it
&quot;tops out&quot; at a given frame rate due to compute
limitations. The constants for those two keys are K_KP_PLUS and
K_KP_MINUS. The keyboard + is harder to use because you have to
separately track the shift operation.</p>
<h2 lang="zxx" class="western">Bronze (no requirements)</h2>
<h2 lang="zxx" class="western">Silver (no requirement)</h2>
<h2 lang="zxx" class="western">Gold</h2>
<h4 lang="zxx" class="western">ConwayLifeGo.py</h4>
<p lang="zxx">The simulation can be greatly accelerated by keeping
track not only of cells that have changed, but also, separately, of
their neighbors. When you think about it, only the neighbors of
changed cells can possibly change in the next generation, so having
that list means you only need to recompute neighbor counts for those
cells in the next generation -- far faster than the current nested
loop. Ensure that you don't add the same cell twice to the list,
doing so will slow down your simulation without actually causing a
logic error.</p>
<p lang="zxx"><span lang="zxx">As part of this, </span><span lang="zxx">add
a generation count, displayed in the title bar, so you can track the
number of generations per second you're able to run.</span></p>
<h2 lang="zxx" class="western">Turning In</h2>
<p lang="zxx">Demo for me each of Python files, and show the source
so I can check style. Upon my approval, submit your code to Populi.</p>
