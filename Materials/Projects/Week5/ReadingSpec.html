Week 5 Background Study</h1>
<h2 lang="zxx" class="western"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt"><b>Queues</b></font></font></h2>
<p lang="zxx">We will have time to cover Stacks in class, but the
three Queue implementations: LinkQueue, DblLinkQueue, and ArrQueue,
are your job to understand, in detail. Do this by attending the
optional Tuesday session this week if you like, and either way, with
LLM assistance. Be sure that you understand, and are ready to be
tested on:</p>
<p lang="zxx">1. General doubly-linked list operations, including how
a head node simplifies the code, addition and removal of nodes, etc.</p>
<p lang="zxx">2. Why we can't just test ArrQueue for emptiness using
only the values of mHead and mTail, and need mEmpty. 
</p>
<p lang="zxx">3. Why we have special case code for empty queue in
LinkQueue.</p>
<p lang="zxx">4. Why Object can be used to stand for any type</p>
<p lang="zxx">5. What the &lt;&gt; notation is about.</p>
<p lang="zxx">6. How an &quot;Iterator&quot; works</p>
<p lang="zxx">But note, that's just a short list, not comprehensive.
Your grade on this reading assignment will depend on your interaction
with the LLM. I will not even supply a list of questions to ask it;
that's your job. I'll look for the following elements in your
conversation:</p>
<p lang="zxx">1. Deeper questions about the concepts than just an
overview of the code.</p>
<p lang="zxx">2. Extending on and/or improving the code.</p>
<p lang="zxx">3. Some sort of generated quiz from the LLM, to test
your comprehension, especially of pointer/reference operations.</p>
<p lang="zxx">4. Catching the LLM in an error.</p>
<p lang="zxx">As an example, here is a link to a conversation I just
did with Claude, on the LinkStack code we discussed in class. Note
that it has all four of these elements, for instance: 1) discussion
of garbage collection details 2) Addition of a dummy node to simplify
the deep copy 3) a four-question quiz 4) Catching the LLM on a fine
point of GC, on its inaccurate criticism of the shallow-copy
alternative (twice!), and on Q4 of the quiz. This is the sort of
conversation I'd like you to do.</p>
<p lang="zxx"><a href="https://claude.ai/share/619168d3-b1a6-4299-9f8a-492f35371f14"><span lang="zxx"><i>Example
Claude Conversation on LinkStack</i></span></a></p>
<p lang="zxx" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">And,
as an example of an actual professional session:</p>
<p lang="zxx">In my own work academically and professionally, I find
LLMs as useful as classic texts. Here's a recent example from my own
work:</p>
<p lang="zxx"><a href="https://claude.ai/share/a6db84a0-401a-4f78-9f5b-e9d8e80f7953"><span lang="zxx">Radar
Interferometry</span></a></p>
<p lang="zxx">Learning to use them in this way is a good skill to
develop.</p>
<h2 lang="zxx" class="western">Turnin</h2>
<p lang="zxx">First demo your conversation to me, and be ready to
point out in your conversation an instance of each of the four things
I asked for above. Once I OK your conversation, submit the full
transcript in PDF form. Call it LLMTranscript.pdf
