Week 1</h1>
<h1 lang="zxx" class="western">Assignments</h1>
<p lang="zxx">This assignment uses PyGame to draw different pieces of
abstract art.   The point is to exercise basic coding concepts such
as lists, loops, if-statements, and functions, but it's a more
entertaining way to do so than, say, checkbook-balancing code.</p>
<h2 lang="zxx" class="western">Basic</h2>
<h4 lang="zxx" class="western">AbstractGridBa.py</h4>
<p lang="zxx">Write code to generate the AbstractGridBa.png image. 
Start with the supplied AbstractGridBa.py file, which offers initial
data structres, e.g. giving the colors and the rectangular areas in
the image, to save you the tedium of figuring those out.</p>
<p lang="zxx">Importantly, you're allowed only one window.set_at call
to set one pixel to a given color -- no other graphical calls.  So,
you'll need to do a nested loop across the range of X/Y coordinates
in the 800x800 image, and determine what color each should be.</p>
<p lang="zxx">Note that AbstractGridBa.png is gray unless your point
is within one of four rectangular regions.  Within those, it is black
if it's in a 40x40 &quot;checkerboard&quot; square that's black. 
(Modulo (%) may be of use here.)  And within the rectangles, and
within white squares, pixels are colored in 100-pixel rings radiating
out from the image center.</p>
<p lang="zxx">You may find it easiest to this incrementally.  Start,
for instance, by getting the background gray, and each rectangle
white.  Then add the black squares, and finally the circular rings</p>
<p lang="zxx">You must write this reasonably elegantly, and with
correct style.  My own implementation has a draw_pattern method of
under 20 lines not counting blank lines and comments.</p>
<h2 lang="zxx" class="western">Bronze</h2>
<h4 lang="zxx" class="western">AbstractPatternBr.py</h4>
<p lang="zxx">Write code to generate AbstractPatternBr.png.  Do this
by making functions for the following:</p>
<p lang="zxx">1. Drawing a shaded &quot;bullseye&quot; circle on
white background within a rectangular area</p>
<p lang="zxx">2. Drawing a grid of circles within a rectangular area,
allowing a choice of solid color or bullseye (the latter by calling
function 1)</p>
<h2 lang="zxx" class="western">Silver (no requirement)</h2>
<h2 lang="zxx" class="western">Gold</h2>
<h4 lang="zxx" class="western">AbstractPatternGo.py</h4>
<p lang="zxx">Add one more method to draw a spiral in a rectangular
area, and use this to create AbstractPatternGo.png.  The spiral bands
are 4 pixels wide, with 4 pixel gaps between.  Yours may be slightly
different from mine, but must be a true continous spiral filling the
region, starting upper left and turning clockwise.</p>
<h2 lang="zxx" class="western">Platinum</h2>
<h4 lang="zxx" class="western">AbstractPatternPl.py</h4>
<p lang="zxx">If there is enough interest, say at least 3 students,
I'll run a Code Art competition for extra credit.   This competition
involves writing a short, elegant bit of code, at most a page or two,
that produces an aesthetically interesting abstract artistic pattern.
 Entries are judged on the combination of code elegance and
cleverness, and on the beauty of the output.  If we run this, I'll
volunteer to add an entry of my own as well.</p>
<h2 lang="zxx" class="western">Turning In</h2>
<p lang="zxx"><span lang="zxx">Demo for me each of </span><span lang="zxx">Python
files, and show the source so I can check style.  Upon my approval,
submit your code to Populi.</span></p>
