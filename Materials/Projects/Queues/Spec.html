Queues and Dynamic Data Structures</h1>
<h1 lang="zxx" class="western">Basic</h1>
<h2 lang="zxx" class="western"><a name="linkqueue"></a>LinkQueue</h2>
<h3 class="western"><a name="add-new-methods"></a>Add New Methods</h3>
<p lang="zxx">Use the LinkQueue class included with this assignment.
This has the code we wrote in class.</p>
<p lang="zxx">Complete the supplied copy constructor method so you
can make a new LinkQueue that is a copy of another. Note the
instructional comment in the Java file. This can be a two-line
method.</p>
<p lang="zxx">Complete the addToEnd method, following the comments in
the Java file. In particular do not use any loop for this. Just
change a few pointers.</p>
<p lang="zxx">Complete the undoAdd method, again following the
comments.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="test-the-methods"></a>Test the methods</h3>
<p lang="zxx">Use the supplied test code in the main function, and
add a few lines of your own in the same spirit. Hand in a screenshot
of your LinkQueue main running correctly in Eclipse.</p>
<h2 lang="zxx" class="western"><a name="dbllinkqueue"></a>DblLinkQueue</h2>
<h3 class="western"><a name="add-isgood-method"></a>Add isGood method</h3>
<p lang="zxx">Doubly linked lists are complex, with lots of pointer
changes you have to get right. Any time you have such a complex data
structure, it's a good idea to write a structure-checking routine,
which you can call after you do other operations to ensure the
structure is still correct. So, before you do anything else, write
the code for isGood, which traverses every node of the list,
including the head node, and makes sure that it connects properly to
its two neighbors, and that they point back to it properly.</p>
<p lang="zxx">There's an isGood call just after the first three add
calls. Confirm that this results in &quot;true&quot;. Then, briefly
make a small error in&nbsp;<code class="western">add</code>, and see
that isGood returns false.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="add-new-methods2"></a>Add New Methods</h3>
<p lang="zxx">Complete the following&nbsp;<strong>one at a time</strong>:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p lang="zxx">remove</p>
	<li><p lang="zxx">undoAdd</p>
	<li><p lang="zxx">addToEnd</p>
</ul>
<p lang="zxx">As you write each one, do the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p lang="zxx">Respect the comments regarding number of
	lines/pointer-changes.</p>
	<li><p lang="zxx">Draw diagrams! You'll need them to keep track of
	what you're doing.</p>
	<li><p lang="zxx">Consider empty-queue cases, but only add
	if-statements when you have to. (You may find you almost never need
	to, which is the main advantage of a head node.)</p>
	<li><p lang="zxx">After you do each routine, write at least one call
	of it in main(), followed by&nbsp;<code class="western">isGood</code>&nbsp;calls
	on any queues affected by it.</p>
</ul>
<p lang="zxx">Writing and checking these&nbsp;<strong>one at a
time</strong>&nbsp;will give you step by step progress, and
incremental debugging challenges. Don't write it all at once.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="create-an-iterator-class"></a>Create an
Iterator class</h3>
<p lang="zxx">Next do these steps, again checking with test code
(e.g. using a foreach loop on a DblLinkQueue):</p>
<ul>
	<li><p lang="zxx">Write an iterator class that has&nbsp;<code class="western">hasNext</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code class="western">next</code>.
	For now, leave&nbsp;<code class="western">remove</code>&nbsp;unimplemented,
	as we did for LinkQueue.</p>
	<li><p lang="zxx">Write a copy constructor.</p>
	<li><p lang="zxx">Now, add a valid&nbsp;<code class="western">remove</code>,
	noting that per docs,&nbsp;<code class="western">remove</code>&nbsp;removes
	the most recently returned item from&nbsp;<code class="western">next</code>.
	Iterate over a queue and do some removes. Check the result
	with&nbsp;<code class="western">isGood</code>.</p>
</ul>
<h3 class="western"><a name="test-the-methods2"></a>Test the methods</h3>
<p lang="zxx">Comment out your test main (but leave it so you can
submit it) and uncomment the main I supplied. Be sure everything
still works correctly under my main program.</p>
<h2 lang="zxx" class="western"><a name="arrqueue"></a>ArrQueue</h2>
<p lang="zxx">Use the ArrQueue class from class for this assignemnt.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="write-add-and-remove"></a>Write add and
remove</h3>
<p lang="zxx">Start by writing the add and remove methods, so you can
test the queue. You'll need to take the mEmpty flag into account in
add, and set it in both add and remove under the right circumstances.
If the array is already full and you're adding a new value, resize
the array, and also undo any wrapping when you copy the old data into
the new larger new array. Write tests that wrap the queue, that cause
a resizing, and that ultimately empty the queue.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="write-getsize"></a>Write getSize</h3>
<p lang="zxx">This method must cover several cases: the normal case
where mHead &lt;= mTail, the wrapped case, the empty case, and the
totally-full case (note that both of these latter cases have mHead ==
mTail). Add getSize calls to your earlier tests to be sure you get
the right size in all cases.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="write-equals"></a>Write equals</h3>
<p lang="zxx">Checking equality of two ArrQueues is tricky since they
may have the same contents, but not the same mHead/mTail values. As
long as they have the same contents, in the same order, they are
equal. And, the contents themselves (which are Object references,
recall) must be deep-equal compared, not just shallow equal.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="write-the-arriterator-class-and-the-iterator-function"></a>
Write the ArrIterator class, and the iterator function</h3>
<p lang="zxx">The ArrIterator must work even for ArrQueues that are
wrapped around, and it must distinguish between cases where the queue
is empty and mHead == mTail, and where it is full and mHead == mTail.</p>
<p lang="zxx">When you write ArrIterator:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p lang="zxx">Write an iterator class that has&nbsp;<code class="western">hasNext</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code class="western">next</code>.</p>
	<li><p lang="zxx">For now, leave&nbsp;<code class="western">remove</code>&nbsp;unimplemented,
	as we did for LinkQueue.</p>
	<li><p lang="zxx">Test next and hasNext, using a foreach loop in the
	main.</p>
	<li><p lang="zxx">Now, add a valid&nbsp;<code class="western">remove</code>,
	noting that per docs,&nbsp;<code class="western">remove</code>&nbsp;removes
	the most recently returned item from&nbsp;<code class="western">next</code>.
	Iterate over a queue and do some removes.</p>
</ul>
<h3 class="western"><a name="test-the-methods3"></a>Test the methods</h3>
<p lang="zxx">Comment out your test main (but leave it so you can
submit it) and uncomment the main I supplied. Be sure everything
still works correctly under my main program.</p>
<h2 lang="zxx" class="western">Turning In</h2>
<p lang="zxx">No demo needed for this assignment.  Instead, submit
each of the three Java files, plus, for each, a screenshot of the
test main (my code plus your improvements) running for each.</p>
